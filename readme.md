# ESP32-BOX

The device has been designed around regular ESP32-module to be fitted inside DIN-rail mounting enclosure. The board designed to be compact as much as possible. It takes 3 DIN-rail positions only.

### Main features:

- The **ESP32-BOX** has internal AC/DC-converter. Thus it could be powered from the regular AC line (i.e. wall socket) 100-240V (no external AC/DC adapters needed);
- The **ESP32-BOX** provides 4 optically isolated Relay outputs (up to 10A/250V or 5A/30V each). Each relay output has its own LED-indicator.
- The **ESP32-BOX** provides 4 GPIOs. Two of them could be used as I2C-line.
- All the inputs and outputs of the **ESP32-BOX** are implemented as reliable screw terminals.
- The **ESP32-BOX** has onboard RGB-led, which could be used for multiple status indications on your taste.
- The top part of the enclosure is transparent. So the LEDs could be easily observed from the outside.
- The **ESP32-BOX** provides powerful external antenna, which is located inside the enclosure. Thanks to `uFL/IPEX1` header any other suitable antenna could be used instead.
- The **ESP32-BOX** is equipped with the external +3dBi antenna hidden inside the enclosure;
- The **ESP32-BOX** could be programmed with the USB Type-C cable (no buttons required).
- The **ESP32-BOX** could be programmed with the ; write your sketches whenever you want: Arduino, CircuitPython, MicroPython or ESP-IDF.
- Finally, **ESP32-BOX** is **ESPHome**-compatible!
